- This dataset includes trip records from all trips completed in yellow taxis from in NYC from January to June in 2016. Records include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts. The data used in the attached datasets were collected and provided to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) by technology providers authorized under the Taxicab Passenger Enhancement Program (TPEP). The trip data was not created by the TLC, and TLC makes no representations as to the accuracy of these data. 


(5) NIH Clinical Center releases dataset of 32,000 CT images [[Download]](https://nihcc.app.box.com/v/DeepLesion)

- The National Institutes of Health’s Clinical Center has made a large-scale dataset of CT images publicly available to help the scientific community improve detection accuracy of lesions. While most publicly available medical image datasets have less than a thousand lesions, this dataset, named DeepLesion, has over 32,000 annotated lesions identified on CT images.
